# T5-summarization-model-training
Training a pre-trained T5 model on custom data.
we change the tensor values of the model by training it on custom data and summarize the documents the much accurately.
The Training process is a supervised learning technique. so, we need to create a corpus that consists of both text documents and it's summary.
It's a time consuming task, but if need to improve the precision of forming summary of model, then we have to do it.

Note : pre-trained T5 model also gives better results, but if you need to get bit more accurate results. then you need to train your model on custom data.
